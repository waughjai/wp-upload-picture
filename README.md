WP Upload Picture
=========================

Class for autogenerating picture tag HTML for WordPress media image with just the ID. Works just like WPUploadImage, but without the need for giving a $sizes string ( since the whole point o’ a picture tag is to be responsive ) & creates an HTMLPicture object ’stead o’ just an HTMLImage object.

Error handling works just as it does for HTMLImage & HTMLPicture objects. Look up the documentation for those classes for mo’ information.
